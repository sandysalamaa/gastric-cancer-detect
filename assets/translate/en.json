  "cancer_specs": "Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, develops slowly over many years, usually starting from precancerous changes in the stomach lining. It is more common in older adults, with an average age of diagnosis around 68 years. Unfortunately, symptoms often do not appear until the cancer reaches an advanced stage, highlighting the importance of regular screenings, especially for individuals with known risk factors. Some of these risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, a family history of gastric cancer, a diet high in salt and processed meats, chronic gastritis, pernicious anaemia, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and certain inherited cancer syndromes. Early detection and timely treatment are crucial for improving outcomes, underscoring the significance of education and awareness about gastric cancer among both patients and healthcare providers.",
  "stage_0": "In Stage 0, also known as carcinoma in situ, abnormal cells are confined to the innermost layer of the stomach lining and have not invaded deeper layers or nearby lymph nodes.  Stage I signifies cancer that is limited to the mucosa of the stomach and may have penetrated into the submucosa or muscularis propria, but it has not yet spread to lymph nodes or other organs. The symptoms can be relatively mild or nonspecific, making them challenging to recognize.\nHowever, here are the symptoms commonly associated with Stage 0 and Stage I gastric cancer:\nStage 0 (Carcinoma in situ): \n• No specific symptoms are typically experienced at this stage. \n • As the cancer is confined to the innermost lining of the stomach, it may not cause noticeable changes or produce distinct symptoms.",
  "stage_1": "• Indigestion as some individuals may feel discomfort after eating or mild indigestion.\n• Abdominal discomfort or pain as some individuals may feel dull ache in stomach. • Some individuals may feel bloated or full even after consuming small amounts of food. \n• A decrease in appetite or feeling satiated with smaller portions may occur. \n• Some individuals may experience weight loss without intentionally trying to lose weight. \n• Feeling nausea and vomiting. Stage II gastric cancer indicates that the cancer has invaded deeper layers of the stomach wall beyond the mucosa and may involve nearby lymph nodes. ",
  "stage_2": "gastric cancer indicates that the cancer has invaded deeper layers of the stomach wall beyond the mucosa and may involve nearby lymph nodes.\nSymptoms: \n• The presence of blood in the stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, which may occur as a result of tumour growth in the stomach. \n• Chronic and recurring heartburn, also known as acid reflux. \n• Some individuals may experience changes in their bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation, which can be indicative of gastric cancer. \n • Anaemia \n • Vomiting blood Stage III signifies cancer that has spread further into the outer layers of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes but has not metastasized to distant organs.",
  "stage_3": "Stage III signifies cancer that has spread further into the outer layers of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes but has not metastasized to distant organs \nSymptoms\n• Persistent and worsening abdominal pain. \n• Difficulty swallowing while eating or drinking.  \n • Weight loss may become more pronounced and occur unintentionally. \n • Persistent indigestion and heartburn. \n • Nausea and vomiting. \n • Generalized fatigue and weakness may be experienced due to the cancer's impact on the body. ",
  "stage_4": "Stage IV gastric cancer indicates that the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lungs, peritoneum, or distant lymph nodes. \n Symptoms:\n• Liver: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), abdominal pain, swelling, and a feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen. \n• Lungs: Persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood. • Peritoneum: Increased abdominal pain and swelling, ascites (abnormal fluid accumulation in the abdomen), and changes in bowel habits. \n• Distant lymph nodes: Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, collarbone, or other areas of the body.",
  "faqs_content": "\nLifestyle:  \n • Maintain your balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits,vegetables,whole grains,lean protein, and healthy fats.  \n • Instead of large meals, consider eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day.  \n • Stay well hydrated by drinking enough water and fluids throughout the day  \n• Avoid tobacco and Alcohol.  \n • Engage in regular physical activity.\n• Seek emotional support from family,friends, or support groups. \n • Follow your medical recommendations from your doctor or healthcare regarding medications,treatments, and follow up appointments.  \n • Follow up your digestive symptoms such as nausea,vomiting,indigestion,or changes in appetite.  \n • Keep an eye on your weight and notify your doctor or healthcare if you experienced extreme weight gain or loss.\nAbout Histopathological Image:             \n A histopathological image refers to an image captured through the microscopic examination of tissue samples. It is obtained by processing and staining thin slices of tissue, typically obtained from biopsies or surgical specimens. These samples are prepared on glass slides and then examined under a microscope by a pathologist or histopathologist. Histopathological images play a critical role in diagnosing and studying various diseases, including cancer. Pathologists analyze these images to identify abnormalities, such as cancerous cells or other pathological conditions. They assess the tissue architecture, cellular features, presence of inflammation, necrosis, or other signs indicative of disease. \n------------\nHow to upload the image to our doctors?\n1- After getting your results from the labs, go to the *upload image* and choose the type of file. \n 2- Choose the image from your media. \n 3- Wait for the successfully uploaded message.  \n------------\n Recommended Labs for this test\n 1- Al- Nahas labs \n 2- Mega Labs\n  3- Auto Labs\n 4- El Mokhtabar Labs\n 5- El Borg Labs",
